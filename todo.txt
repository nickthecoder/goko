Make the mouse mark more intellegent.
	Move Mode should only show the mark on empty points
	Mark Mode should show on all points, but be a different shape

Bugs
	Names not appearing in when editing
	Score takes too long at the start of the game.
		Need to have a timeout, and kill gnugo process and create another instance.
		Also need to "lock" the game, preventing user from moving until board has been scanned (don't need to wait for gnu go process though).
	A pass from Go Problems invokes the game scoring algorithm!
		Also, why is it doing it after a SINGLE pass? Hmm.
	Ko not tested for, and then throws exception when the ko point is played.
		Use board.copy().hash() and compare with all previous nodes.

Consider using move_probabilities for hints, so that multiple points can be returned
	Sort by value, show the top filled in, and the next N hollow.

What should happen when setup stones are added, and then later nodes are invalid moves?

Game score chart
	Show a chart of the game score throughout the game (using GnuGo's estimate).
	Draw a polyline using the first number, and around it, a polygon using the upper and lower bounds.
	Click on the chart to jump to that game node.

Edit games
	Edit meta-data (as a Task)
	Delete branch (warn when deleting main line) (incluce deleting Passes)
	Edit button from JosekiView (navigate to the same node in the copy)
		Create a "NodeNavigation" class?
		Or just use the original's node tree
			GameNode.equals should be able to compare nodes for different games.
	listen to the game being reviewed, and add nodes to the reviewing game as moves are played.
		Add them as the main line in the copy.

Undo option when playing games (separate preference for each type of game)
	When playing a new move, make it the main line, but keep the old node (adding a "Undone" comment).
	When playing against a computer, undo TWO moves

SFGReader
	Comments : Read BYTES, and then convert to a string using the character set as defined within the file.

Icons on the tabs?
Drag tabs to re-arrange them (paratask).

Build a list of all sgf properties in SGFReader including supported,partial,unsupported.

Images for each of the Home view's buttons

Consider using CopyOnWrite for listeners
	Maybe create a special generic class for listeners, with weak references too.

Multiple directories for Go problems, so that Kogo can ship with its own problems AND let the user point to their own collection(s).

Allow for manual placing of handicap stones

When playing against GnuGo, set time limits similar to those on the servers.
	Countdown timers, with human voice and progress bar.
	Make it obvious when a countdown is vital (i.e. you will lose the game).
	A Pause button when time is not limitless (for comfort breaks, phone calls etc).

Use a cut-down version of GoTextProtocol to set up a client/server game across a LAN.
	Or a propriatory protocol?

Hidden Stone Go (via client server)
	Parameters for # of black & white stones
	Parameter for showing your own hidden stones

One Color Go

New Geometry
	Voids where no stones can be placed, and do NOT count as liberties.
	Neutral points, where no stones can be placed, but DO count as liberties.
