Bugs
	Snapbacks kill the player making the move BEFORE the snapback! See Easy problem 7


Go Problems
	Buttons to rate yourself, which is then shown in the ProblemsView grid
	Move to next problem

Load game meta data, such as player names, ranks etc.

Load and show marked points

Game editor/review needs a LOT of work
	Show the game tree.

Images for each of the Home view's buttons

Multiple directories for Go problems, so that Kogo can ship with its own problems AND let the user point to their own collection(s).
	Maybe I should recurse through the directory tree.
	e.g. "Weekly Go Problems/Easy/Part 1" gets flattened to a label of "Weekly Go Problems Easy Part 1"
	Maybe I should automatically split large directories, so that "Part N" is done automatically.
	Don't use the file name as a label, but use a number instead.
		Doing all of the above would allow the weakly go problems to be used without modification.

Save .sgf files

Auto scoring doesn't work (I think I need to wait for a response from GNU Go before sending the next query).

Allow for manual placing of handicap stones

When playing against GnuGo, set time limits similar to those on the servers.
	e.g. 15 minutes, then 30s per move with 3 "extras".
	Countdown timers, with human voice and progress bar.
	Make it obvious when a countdown is vital (i.e. you will lose the game).

All games automatically saved in a stadard place.
	File names are automatic - Server_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.s

Use a cut-down version of GoTextProtocol to set up a client/server game across a LAN.
	Or a propriatory protocol?

Hidden Stone Go (via client server)
	Parameters for # of black & white stones
	Parameter for showing your own hidden stones
