	Score takes too long at the start of the game.
		Need to have a timeout, and kill gnugo process and create another instance.
		Also need to "lock" the game, preventing user from moving until board has been scanned (don't need to wait for gnu go process though).
	A pass from Go Problems invokes the game scoring algorithm!
		Also, why is it doing it after a SINGLE pass? Hmm.
	Ko not tested for, and then throws exception when the ko point is played.
		Use board.copy().hash() and compare with all previous nodes.

Listen to game, and update the challenge match win/loss figures.

Rename ColorVariation to GameVariation

Allow any number of Playing preferences
	Name
	Type (2Player, Man vs Machine, AIChallenge)
	All parameters from that type
Need to have a Task object for each Preference, and for it to create another task, which copies the values.
	i.e. QuickGamePreferences creates QuickGameTask

New Geometry Variation
	Voids where no stones can be placed, and do NOT count as liberties.
	Neutral points, where no stones can be placed, but DO count as liberties.
	Create a GameSetup interface, which is used to place free handicap stones (regular game), voids and neutrals and hidden moves.

Sound for countdowns (voice, beeps and large visuals)

Game score chart
	Show a chart of the game score throughout the game (using GnuGo's estimate).
	Draw a polyline using the first number, and around it, a polygon using the upper and lower bounds.
	Click on the chart to jump to that game node.

Edit games
	Instead of just COPYING a game, also listen to it, adding nodes to the copy as they are played.
		Add them as the main line in the copy.
		WHen Undo is implemented in PlayingView, that will be tricky!
			Will probably have to improve on just the "moved" event.

Undo option when playing games (separate preference for each type of game)
	When playing a new move, make it the main line, but keep the old node (adding a "Undone" comment).
	When playing against a computer, undo TWO moves

SFGReader
	Comments : Read BYTES, and then convert to a string using the character set as defined within the file.

Consider using CopyOnWrite for listeners
	Maybe create a special generic class for listeners, with weak references too.


Use a cut-down version of GoTextProtocol to set up a client/server game across a LAN.
	Or a propriatory protocol?

Images for each of the Home view's buttons

Consider using move_probabilities for hints, so that multiple points can be returned
	Sort by value, show the top filled in, and the next N hollow.

Hidden Stone Go (via client server)
	Parameters for # of black & white stones
	Parameter for showing your own hidden stones
