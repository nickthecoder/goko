Task to download Kogo joseki db and weekly problems
	Maybe renaming them so that 100 is after 99.

LocalPlayer.yourTurn should call the view to let it know that it can accept input.
	Remove Player.canClickToPlay
	LocalPlayer will need a ref to the view.
	ProblemPlayer and ProblemOpponent should both extend LocalPlayer.

Implement greyed out stones (part of SGF)

Allow for dispute resolution at the end of the game.
	Do final count, and prompt each "clickable" player if they agree.
	If not, then copy the board and have them continue playing, without passing, until all dead stones have been removed.
		Actually, just rememeber the node that game ended on.
		All points played are marked (or greyed out).
	Need a message to tell players that playing into your own territory will NOT count against them.
	Now take off the dead stones from the end-of-game copy and score that. (Assuming Japanese rules of course).

TimeLimit should be TWO classes, one for the time limit and another for the time remaining.
	Countdown stuff only in the later.
	Don't countdown at the end of main time if there is byomi or overtime.
	Additional warning if this countdown will lose you the game.

Hidden Move Go
	Parameters for # of black & white stones
	Parameter for showing your own hidden stones (As a stone with/without a mark, a mark only or not at all).
	Parameter for revealed stones (marked or not marked).

New Geometry Variation
	StoneColor.isPlayable and isEmpty are NOT the same, when neutral points are introduced.
	Voids where no stones can be placed, and do NOT count as liberties.
	Neutral points, where no stones can be placed, but DO count as liberties.
	Create a GameSetup interface, which is used to place free handicap stones (regular game), voids and neutrals and hidden moves.

Note. When other game variations are implemented, they must have a "Supports GnuGo" boolean.
	Don't show the "score" button in this case.
