Bugs
	Guan Zi Problems doesn't specify a 1st player in root node (I think)
	Cho's problems don't open correctly. They appear as a single problem instead of multiples.

	HiddenStones are sometimes revealed when they don't have to be.
		When a group of hidden-only stones are removed, they don't need to be revealed.
		We'd need to change how taken stones are returned. As a list of lists, rather than one big list.

Current Task - HiddenMoveGo
	Display messages - 
	Check for stones with no liberties at the start of the game - rare!
		What if two pon nukis take each other? Take both of them.
		Place all stones, check for liberties, and remember those to remove in a single list
		Remove the dead stones after all liberties are checked.

	Don't allow undo/redo while playing hidden move go.
	Prevent "Review" and Score etc

Allow downloading of unzipped files such as :
	https://github.com/mango314/scrapeGo

Use GnuGo to check Go Problem solutions.
	Click "Defend", then the group to defend
	of "Attack" and then the group to attack

From EditGameView, continue a game against GnuGo.

Add some standard games when games preferences are empty.

Add images to the GoKo wiki page.
Update the README to point to the wiki page, rather than repeat the information.

Task to download Kogo joseki db and weekly problems
	A button on the preferences page.
	Copy the directory parameter value, and this time, make it required.
	Maybe renaming them so that 100 is after 99.

LocalPlayer.yourTurn should call the view to let it know that it can accept input.
	Remove Player.canClickToPlay
	LocalPlayer will need a ref to the view.
	ProblemPlayer and ProblemOpponent should both extend LocalPlayer.

TimeLimit should be TWO classes, one for the time limit and another for the time remaining.
	Countdown stuff only in the later.
	Don't countdown at the end of main time if there is byomi or overtime.
	Additional warning if this countdown will lose you the game.

Hidden Move Go
	Parameters for # of black & white stones
	Parameter for showing your own hidden stones (As a stone with/without a mark, a mark only or not at all).
	Parameter for revealed stones (marked or not marked).

New Geometry Variation
	StoneColor.isPlayable and isEmpty are NOT the same, when neutral points are introduced.
	Voids where no stones can be placed, and do NOT count as liberties.
	Neutral points, where no stones can be placed, but DO count as liberties.
	Create a GameSetup interface, which is used to place free handicap stones (regular game), voids and neutrals and hidden moves.
	Can't save this as standard sgf ;-(
		Maybe use a differen game id, and make up my own sgf properties
		Use a hash of "geometry go" as the id? (or whatever I end up calling it)

Note. When other game variations are implemented, they must have a "Supports GnuGo" boolean.
	Don't show the "score" button in this case.

Implement greyed out stones (part of SGF)

Allow for dispute resolution at the end of the game.
	Do final count, and prompt each "clickable" player if they agree.
	If not, then copy the board and have them continue playing, without passing, until all dead stones have been removed.
		Actually, just rememeber the node that game ended on.
		All points played are marked (or greyed out).
	Need a message to tell players that playing into your own territory will NOT count against them.
	Now take off the dead stones from the end-of-game copy and score that. (Assuming Japanese rules of course).
