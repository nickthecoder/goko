	Challenge match didn't update its stats when I resigned (after a timed-out final status, due to a 3second timeout).

Add Dimmed marks
	(reader, writer and editor)

New modes
	GnuGo Attack, Defend
		Click a dragon for a hint to attack or defend it.
		Make the "Hint" button a pulldown button?

LocalPlayer.yourTurn should call the view to let it know that it can accept input.
	Remove Player.canClickToPlay
	LocalPlayer will need a ref to the view.
	ProblemPlayer and ProblemOpponent should both extend LocalPlayer.

TimeLimit should be TWO classes, one for the time limit and another for the time remaining.
	Countdown stuff only in the later.
	Don't countdown at the end of main time if there is byomi or overtime.
	Additional warning if this countdown will lose you the game.
	Remove "Overtime Period", and only show overtime periods if Byo Yomi is for 1 move.

Allow Hidden Move Go against GnuGo, but GnoGo has full info of the game (so it's one sided hidden).
	GnuGo is asked to place free handicap stones(regardless of what color it really is)
		Or maybe the stones are chosen for it.

Option for HiddenMoveGo to let players reposition their stones if there is a conflict.

Another version of Hidden Move Go. Call it Hidden Extras Moves.
	Instead of the board actually having the hidden stones on the board, the hidden moves are just EXTRA moves,
	that a player can make. They are NOT on the board until revealed.
	If a player clicks on a hidden move point, then the point is revealed.
		So to use a hidden move to capture, you first click the hidden move point, then click the capture point.
		i.e. you have an EXTRA turn.

New Geometry Variation
	StoneColor.isPlayable and isEmpty are NOT the same, when neutral points are introduced.
	Voids where no stones can be placed, and do NOT count as liberties.
	Neutral points, where no stones can be placed, but DO count as liberties.
	Create a GameSetup interface, which is used to place free handicap stones (regular game), voids and neutrals and hidden moves.
	Can't save this as standard sgf ;-(
		Maybe use a differen game id, and make up my own sgf properties
		Use a hash of "geometry go" as the id? (or whatever I end up calling it)

Note. When other game variations are implemented, they must have a "Supports GnuGo" boolean.
	Don't show the "score" button in this case.

Allow for dispute resolution at the end of the game.
	Do final count, and prompt each "clickable" player if they agree.
	If not, then copy the board and have them continue playing, without passing, until all dead stones have been removed.
		Actually, just rememeber the node that game ended on.
		All points played are marked (or greyed out).
	Need a message to tell players that playing into your own territory will NOT count against them.
	Now take off the dead stones from the end-of-game copy and score that. (Assuming Japanese rules of course).
