Bugs
	A pass from Go Problems invokes the game scoring algorithm!
		Also, why is it doing it after a SINGLE pass? Hmm.
	Ko not tested for, and then trows exception when a ko is played.

Go Problems
	Notification when straying outside of the solution's game tree.
	Cheat mode to highlight the main line of play.

SFGReader
	Comments : Read BYTES, and then convert to a string using the character set as defined within the file.

Use Line class instead of Canvas to render the board lines.
Render stones anti-aliased - this may mean I abandon the current method of showing them.

Icons on the tabs?
Drag tabs to re-arrange them (paratask).

Load game meta data, such as player names, ranks etc.

Load and show marked points

Game editor/review needs a LOT of work
	Show the game tree.

Images for each of the Home view's buttons

Review games after playing them
	Edit whole game tree
	Get hints from GnuGo

Replace the scaled canvas with a fixed size canvas.
	It will be smaller, and allow for single pixel width lines
	No need for the blur to make the lines appear uniform ;-)

Multiple directories for Go problems, so that Kogo can ship with its own problems AND let the user point to their own collection(s).
	Maybe I should recurse through the directory tree.
	e.g. "Weekly Go Problems/Easy/Part 1" gets flattened to a label of "Weekly Go Problems Easy Part 1"
	Maybe I should automatically split large directories, so that "Part N" is done automatically.
	Don't use the file name as a label, but use a number instead.
		Doing all of the above would allow the weakly go problems to be used without modification.

Save .sgf files

Auto scoring doesn't work (I think I need to wait for a response from GNU Go before sending the next query).

Allow for manual placing of handicap stones

When playing against GnuGo, set time limits similar to those on the servers.
	e.g. 15 minutes, then 30s per move with 3 "extras".
	Countdown timers, with human voice and progress bar.
	Make it obvious when a countdown is vital (i.e. you will lose the game).

All games automatically saved in a stadard place.
	File names are automatic - Server_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.s

Use a cut-down version of GoTextProtocol to set up a client/server game across a LAN.
	Or a propriatory protocol?

Hidden Stone Go (via client server)
	Parameters for # of black & white stones
	Parameter for showing your own hidden stones

One Color Go

Joseki
	Load Kogo's joseki database (not related to my software - oops, perhaps I should rename mine!)
	Allow board to be rotated/reflected
