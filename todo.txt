Go Client
---------
Write using Kotlin and JavaFX

When playing against GnuGo, set time limits similar to those on the servers.
	e.g. 15 minutes, then 30s per move with 3 "extras".
	Countdown timers, with human voice and progress bar.
	Make it obvious when a countdown is vital (i.e. you will lose the game).

Allow scoring the board during play. Tag dead stones using keyboard shortcut + mouse.

Single window interface? If I ever want to play 2 simultaneous games, then open 2 windows!

At first, only implement 1 account per server, and don't do the registration stuff.

Home screen shows large buttons for :
	Preferences
	Play against GnuGo
	Play on Server X
	View saved games

All games are automatically saved in a stadard place.
	File names are automatic - Server_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM.s

Use ParaTask for preferences???

Go problems
	Have a list of directories to search for problems.
	Flattern out the directory structure, and display each directory as a top-level item
	Allow user to give themselves a star rating, and display it similar to puzzle games
		In a grid : Perfect, OK, Fail, not solved.

	Or a propriatory protocol?
