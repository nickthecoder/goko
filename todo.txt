GNUGo not getting remove-stones event.

Undo option when playing games (separate preference for each type of game)
	When playing a new move, make it the main line, but keep the old node (adding a "Undone" comment).
	When playing against a computer, undo TWO moves
	When Playing, new branches must be put in the main line i.e. child#0 (boolean on BoardView?)

MultipleParameter to render as a list and detail. This will allow re-ordering.

Bugs	
	Only taking a single pass to end the game
	GnuGo is placing the stones, even when I'm black (was one color go though ;-)
		I think the handicap stone is being put in the wrong place.	

	Score takes too long at the start of the game.
		Need to have a timeout, and kill gnugo process and create another instance.
		Also need to "lock" the game, preventing user from moving until board has been scanned (don't need to wait for gnu go process though).
	A pass from Go Problems invokes the game scoring algorithm!
		Also, why is it doing it after a SINGLE pass? Hmm.
	Ko not tested for, and then throws exception when the ko point is played.
		Use board.copy().hash() and compare with all previous nodes.

Save GamesPreferences in a readable manner (improve paratask, and then use that code to write the tasks parameters)

Move ProblemPlayer into GameVariation
	i.e. Create a GoProblem: GameVariation, and have that update the comments when a weird move is played.

Game score chart
	Show a chart of the game score throughout the game (using GnuGo's estimate).
	Draw a polyline using the first number, and around it, a polygon using the upper and lower bounds.
	Click on the chart to jump to that game node.

SFGReader
	Comments : Read BYTES, and then convert to a string using the character set as defined within the file.

Consider using CopyOnWrite for listeners
	Maybe create a special generic class for listeners, with weak references too.

Use a cut-down version of GoTextProtocol to set up a client/server game across a LAN.
	Or a propriatory protocol?

Hidden Stone Go (via client server)
	Parameters for # of black & white stones
	Parameter for showing your own hidden stones

New Geometry Variation
	StoneColor.isPlayable and isEmpty are NOT the same, when neutral points are introduced.
	Voids where no stones can be placed, and do NOT count as liberties.
	Neutral points, where no stones can be placed, but DO count as liberties.
	Create a GameSetup interface, which is used to place free handicap stones (regular game), voids and neutrals and hidden moves.
