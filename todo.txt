Bugs	
	Home buttons not updating after editing the Games Preferences
	Pass button visible, but disabled on joseki view and problem view.
	Can go back/forwards using arrow keys, but no buttons from ProblemView
		Back should set to Maybe, forward to fail??? (If there is a move available).

Task to download KoGo joseki db and weekly problems
	Maybe renaming them so that 100 is after 99.

TimeLimit should be TWO classes, one for the time limit and another for the time remaining.
	Countdown stuff only in the later.

Aji Vision
	Use whatever data GnuGo gives to analyse a board.
	By diffing two territory estimates will show hot-spots
		Check with an "undecided" group.
	Color each type of data differently, and maybe let multiple data types overlap.
		dragon_stones (point) Lists the stones in the dragon
		dragon_status (dragon point)
		is_surrounded (dragon point)
		initial_influence (color)
			white_influence (float)
			black_influence (float)
			white_strength (float)
			black_strength (float)
			white_attenuation (float)
			black_attenuation (float)
			white_permeability (float)

Hidden Move Go
	Parameters for # of black & white stones
	Parameter for showing your own hidden stones (As a stone with/without a mark, a mark only or not at all).
	Parameter for revealed stones (marked or not marked).

New Geometry Variation
	StoneColor.isPlayable and isEmpty are NOT the same, when neutral points are introduced.
	Voids where no stones can be placed, and do NOT count as liberties.
	Neutral points, where no stones can be placed, but DO count as liberties.
	Create a GameSetup interface, which is used to place free handicap stones (regular game), voids and neutrals and hidden moves.

Note. When other game variations are implemented, they must have a "Supports GnuGo" boolean.
	Don't show the "score" button in this case.
