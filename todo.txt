	Score takes too long at the start of the game.
		Need to have a timeout, and kill gnugo process and create another instance.
		Also need to "lock" the game, preventing user from moving until board has been scanned (don't need to wait for gnu go process though).
	A pass from Go Problems invokes the game scoring algorithm!
		Also, why is it doing it after a SINGLE pass? Hmm.
	Ko not tested for, and then throws exception when the ko point is played.
		Use board.copy().hash() and compare with all previous nodes.

Sound for countdowns (voice, beeps and large visuals)

		Add them as the main line in the copy.

Undo option when playing games (separate preference for each type of game)
	When playing a new move, make it the main line, but keep the old node (adding a "Undone" comment).
	When playing against a computer, undo TWO moves

SFGReader
	Comments : Read BYTES, and then convert to a string using the character set as defined within the file.

Consider using CopyOnWrite for listeners
	Maybe create a special generic class for listeners, with weak references too.


Use a cut-down version of GoTextProtocol to set up a client/server game across a LAN.
	Or a propriatory protocol?

Consider using move_probabilities for hints, so that multiple points can be returned
