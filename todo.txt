	Free handicap stones aren't showing up when editing. Where they adde to the root node?
	
	Score takes too long at the start of the game.
		Need to have a timeout, and kill gnugo process and create another instance.
		Also need to "lock" the game, preventing user from moving until board has been scanned (don't need to wait for gnu go process though).
	A pass from Go Problems invokes the game scoring algorithm!
		Also, why is it doing it after a SINGLE pass? Hmm.
	Ko not tested for, and then throws exception when the ko point is played.
		Use board.copy().hash() and compare with all previous nodes.

Use alt for nav

What should happen when setup stones are added, and then later nodes are invalid moves?

Game score chart

	Draw a polyline using the first number, and around it, a polygon using the upper and lower bounds.
	Click on the chart to jump to that game node.

Edit games
	Delete branch (warn when deleting main line) (incluce deleting Passes)
	Edit button from JosekiView (navigate to the same node in the copy)
		Create a "NodeNavigation" class?
		Or just use the original's node tree
			GameNode.equals should be able to compare nodes for different games.
	listen to the game being reviewed, and add nodes to the reviewing game as moves are played.
		Add them as the main line in the copy.

Undo option when playing games (separate preference for each type of game)
	When playing a new move, make it the main line, but keep the old node (adding a "Undone" comment).
	When playing against a computer, undo TWO moves

SFGReader
	Comments : Read BYTES, and then convert to a string using the character set as defined within the file.

Icons on the tabs?

Consider using CopyOnWrite for listeners
	Maybe create a special generic class for listeners, with weak references too.

Sound for countdowns (voice, beeps and large visuals)

Use a cut-down version of GoTextProtocol to set up a client/server game across a LAN.
	Or a propriatory protocol?

Images for each of the Home view's buttons

Consider using move_probabilities for hints, so that multiple points can be returned
	Sort by value, show the top filled in, and the next N hollow.

Hidden Stone Go (via client server)
	Parameters for # of black & white stones
	Parameter for showing your own hidden stones
